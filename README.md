# Lululemon Awareness and Purchase Intention Analysis

## About
This project examines the relationship between a student’s lifestyle and gender versus their awareness, perception, and purchase intention of Lululemon products. Data was collected through a survey at UBC, and hypotheses were tested using regression analysis conducted in SPSS.

---

## Objectives
1. **Evaluate the Impact of Past Purchases**:
   - Hypothesis: Purchasing Lululemon in the past increases awareness, perception, and purchase intention.
2. **Activity Levels and Awareness**:
   - Hypothesis: More hours spent being active leads to higher awareness.
3. **Participation in UBC Sports Teams**:
   - Hypothesis: UBC sports team members have higher awareness of Lululemon.
4. **Gender Differences**:
   - Hypothesis: Females exhibit higher awareness, perception, and purchase intention than males.
5. **Spending on Activewear**:
   - Hypothesis: Higher spending on activewear correlates with increased purchase intention.

## Methodology
### **Data Collection**
- Surveyed students at UBC, collecting data on:
  - Gender
  - Hours active per week
  - Participation in UBC sports teams
  - Past purchases of Lululemon products
  - Monthly spending on activewear

### **Data Analysis**
- Independent variables:
  - Gender
  - Past purchases
  - UBC sports team participation
  - Hours active
  - Monthly spending on activewear
- Created dummy variables for categorical data.
- Ran multiple regressions using SPSS to test hypotheses.

## Results
### **1. Impact of Past Purchases**
- **Findings**:
  - Strong positive correlation with awareness, perception, and purchase intention.
  - Example: Each unit increase in past purchases raised awareness by 0.189.
- **Statistical Indicators**:
  - High significance (< 0.01).
  - Adjusted R² = 0.38.
  - Some heteroscedasticity observed in residuals.

### **2. Activity Levels and Awareness**
- **Findings**:
  - No significant relationship between hours active and awareness.
  - Exception: Less than 2 hours of activity had a small positive impact.
- **Statistical Indicators**:
  - Adjusted R² = 0.084.
  - High variance in activity levels.

### **3. Gender Differences**
- **Findings**:
  - Females had slightly higher purchase intention than males (0.088).
  - Awareness and perception differences were not significant.
- **Statistical Indicators**:
  - Purchase Intention: Adjusted R² = 0.085, significance < 0.05.
  - Awareness: Adjusted R² = 0.005.

### **4. Spending on Activewear**
- **Findings**:
  - Monthly spending on activewear had no significant impact on purchase intention.
  - High variance between spending categories.
- **Statistical Indicators**:
  - Adjusted R² = 0.005, significance > 0.05.

## Limitations
- **Sample Size**:
  - Limited to UBC students, which may not generalize to a wider population.
- **Heteroscedasticity**:
  - Observed in some models, indicating variability in residuals.
- **High Variance**:
  - Activity levels and spending categories showed significant variability.
